## Introduction

Cloud Computing (CC) has revolutionized the IT industry, offering a plethora of computational services. With the proliferation of cloud service providers (CSPs), choosing the right one becomes challenging. This project introduces a novel Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to facilitate cloud service selection.

# What i've done : 
I implemented the code andall the result are coherante with paper findings 
Paper reference : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063529

## Features

- Integrates relative preferences of criteria and alternatives
- Uses TOPSIS and BWM methodologies for ranking CSPs
- Demonstrates efficiency and correctness through use-case scenarios
- Outperforms traditional methods like AHP in terms of computational complexity and consistency
